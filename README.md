# A study of stochastic gene regulatory networks

In this work we use the ideas found in the Murrugarra paper, [Modeling stochasticity andVariability in Gene](http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S1793524518500328), and the Akman paper, [Dynamics of Gene Regulatory Networks with Stochastic Propensities](https://doi.org/10.1142/S1793524518500328), to createan R program to show that the propensities found in Gene Networks are not in fact seen asconstant, rather they can be values that can be changed with a certain probability. In thisdocument, we explain the ideas behind each paper previously published on this subject, weexplain, in a general sense, what the code does to then later on show what can result fromthe special case of three genes.
