# A study of stochastic gene regulatory networks

In this work we use the ideas found in the Murrugarra paper, Modeling stochasticity andVariability in Gene, and the Akman paper, Dynamics of Gene Regulatory Networks, to createan R program to show that the propensities found in Gene Networks are not in fact seen asconstant, rather they can be values that can be changed with a certain probability. In thisdocument, we explain the ideas behind each paper previously published on this subject, weexplain, in a general sense, what the code does to then later on show what can result fromthe special case of three genes.
